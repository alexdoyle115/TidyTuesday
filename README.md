# TidyTuesday
 My attempts at data visualisation with data coming from the  `https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday`
 
 Starting with **week 8** of 2021 the data is based off of the legacy of W.E.B duBois, the aim was to attempt challenge09 but on that had to quickly change to the gganimated plot we now see.
